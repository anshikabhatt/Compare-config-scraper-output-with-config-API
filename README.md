# Compare-config-scraper-output-with-config-API
This repository is my submission for the task #T332647. In this task, we were supposed to compare the API result with scraper output.
 
## Description
 The goal of this task was to compare the output of the scraper developed for Task #T331201 with the results obtained from the API. To accomplish this, I created a parser script that fetched data from the API endpoint and parsed it into a CSV file named "scraper_output.csv". This file contained all the relevant information from the API endpoint that was necessary for the comparison. After creating the "scraper_output.csv" file, I used the "compare_csv.py" script to compare the contents of this file with the output generated by the scraper developed for Task #T331201. The comparison script compared each field of data from both sources and identified any discrepancies between them. This allowed me to identify any errors or inconsistencies in the scraper output and determine whether the scraper was generating accurate results.
Overall, the use of the parser script and the comparison script provided an effective way to compare the scraper output with the results obtained from the API. This allowed me to ensure that the scraper was generating accurate and consistent results, and helped to identify any areas that required improvement.
